--- RELEASE NOTES ---

Date: 17 September 2006

Execute Query is an operating system independent database utility.

Execute Query Version 3.0final
------------------------------

Execute Query has been significantly redesigned for version 3.0beta and includes
a number of new features in addition to extensions and enhancements of all 
previous components and functions.

Central to the redesign has been the underlying layout of the application. The 
MDI interface has been replaced by an easier to use and more responsive tabbed 
panel interface. This has allowed some components that were previously almost
stand-alone internal frames to be more central and controlling features such as
the database schema browser which now functions as a primary and controlling 
component.

New feature highlights summary:

  - Tabbed interface with draggable docked side panels.
  - Multiple database connections.
  - Redesigned query editor allowing more intuitive query execution
    as well as allowing multiple result sets in a new tabbed environment.
  - Wizard style functionality for the more complex tasks.
  - Import/export enhancements including binary object support.
  - Redesigned tools and tool configuration.
  - Draggable/clickable SQL keyword list
  - Improved JDBC driver detection
  - Stored object execution
  - Improved logging and file output
  - Improved table printing
  - Data type comparison across different databases
  - Enhanced SQL script generation
  - ... and many more


Further usability features have been added including more customisation features 
and keyboard shortcuts to often used editor commands including query execution
and the commit and rollback of statements.

The documentation has also been completely rebuilt.

Thanks to those who submitted bugs and suggestions. Keep them coming!
